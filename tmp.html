      <p><a href="http://www.mentoringpittsburgh.org/" target="_blank"> The Mentoring Partnership of Southwestern Pennsylvania</a> (TMP) is a non-profit organization that supports local mentoring programs with specialized trainings. TMP is our team’s client for the MHCI Capstone: an 8 month long project that includes researching a problem space, designing and testing potential solutions, and delivering a final product to our client.</p>
    </br>
      <p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>
      <p>In mid January of 2017, TMP approached us with the following problem to kick off our project:</p>
      <p><i>There are ~1000 youths in Southwestern Pennsylvania alone that ask for mentors but do not receive them.</i></p>

    </br>
      <p><strong>Our Solution</strong></p>
      <div class="col-md-6" style="padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;">
        <p>Our team took a human-centered design approach to dissect and solve this issue in the mentoring landscape. </p>
        <p>Currently, we are at the halfway point of our project. After four months of rigorous research, synthesis, envisioning, and communicating with TMP, we have chosen to pursue the opportunity area of <a href="http://www.mentoringpittsburgh.org/pages/everyday-mentoring" target="blank">Everyday Mentoring</a>. This informal way of mentoring has the potential to empower adults to become aware of the positive impacts they can have on youth in their lives through daily interactions. As we move forward, we will be prototyping and testing solutions that will increase awareness of Everyday Mentoring, make it more available to those working with youth, and allow for the movement to grow to a national level.</p>

        <div align="center" class="w3-content"><img align="center" class="w3-image" src="images/tmp/em_logo.png"></img></div>
      </div>

    </br>
      <p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
      <p>To get a sense of the initial problem’s context, we explored the existing mentoring landscape: the research behind the best practices, the influencers and thought leaders in the space, and the methods deployed by TMP and their associates.</p>
      <p>The findings from this secondary research allowed our team to constructively communicate with TMP in order to refine our problem space. The project goal evolved to focus on two areas:
      <ul>
        <li>Ensure the <b><i>quality</i></b> of mentoring relationships</li>
        <li>Increase the <b><i>quantity</i></b> of mentors available to youth</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <img class="w3-image" src="images/tmp/question_mapping.jpg"></img>
      <br/><br/>
      <p>These two areas ultimately guided our primary research, where we set out to talk to mentors, mentees, and program staff in southwestern Pennsylvania. To form the key questions and concerns we had about each of our problem spaces, our team utilized “question mapping”. This synthesis tool allowed us to state the issues we saw within each problem space, as well as to map questions with each issue. These questions, written in the form of “how might we…” laid the foundation of our primary research questions. For a more in-depth look at this sythesis experience, check out my <a href="https://medium.com/making-things-usable/synthesis-sunday-1-question-mapping-c86b51ed7c59" target="blank">Medium article</a> about it.</p>
      <p>Over the course of our research, the primary interview questions we asked evolved to narrow in on insightful nuggets. Over two months, we interviewed and observed 15 mentors, 7 mentees, and 9 program staff from a variety of mentoring backgrounds and programs. </p>
      <p>We began synthesizing our primary research by constructing an affinity diagram, and clustering similar ideas. These clustered groups became our primary research insights, which we then presented to TMP and collaboratively narrowed the problem space to a handful of specific opportunities. </p>

      </div>

      <p>In order to validate our assumptions, our team constructed storyboards of potential solutions in each of our opportunity spaces. We then performed a number of speed-dating sessions and were able to identify which opportunities seemed to have the most potential in further exploring.</p>
      <!-- add pics of storyboards-->

        <img class="w3-image" src="images/tmp/storyboard2.png" style="width:50%; padding-top: 3px;padding-bottom: 25px">
      </div>
      <p>As we move forward, our team will begin a broad expansion of potential solutions, and will be iteratively developing prototypes and testing them with mentors, mentees, and program staff. By mid August 2017, our team will present a concrete solution that we believe has the ability to alter the entire mentoring landscape for the better.</p>
