      <p>This project was born out of finding an audience, context, and meaningful purpose for an emerging technology. Our group chose to explore the usage of augmented reality to implement virtual therapy animals for all age groups of different occupations.</p>

      <p>Interacting with animals is known to provide therapeutic value to people, alleviating stress and promoting well-being. Based on our research on therapeutic animals, we created a Kickstarter video for pAwws, an application that allows users to interact with a variety of animals, including those not typically available to play with (e.g., pandas)  in an augmented reality setting. This application will make animal therapy easily accessible to users who are experiencing stress wherever they are – at school, in the office, or at home.</p>

      <p><strong>Exploring the Problem Space</strong></p>
      <p>From the onset of this project, our group had an interested in focusing on mental health. To begin exploring this area, our team turned to existing academic literature focusing around depression, anxiety, and stress. Throughout our research, we came across the idea of therapeutic pets.</p>
      <p>Many schools around the country, including Carnegie Mellon University, bring dogs and other animals on campus to help students destress. Animals have also been used to promote social engagement in those with diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Therapeutic pet robots have been developed to improve well-being of elders. Our group decided that mixed reality would be an interest way to extend the benefits of therapy to users who may not be able to afford pets, or have access to therapy pet sessions.</p>

      <p><strong>Ideating Solutions</strong></p>
      <p>Our group began exploring the ways in which augmented animal therapy could benefit particular groups of people. In our ideation phase, we envisioned three contexts in which we believe can be greatly impacted from an AR solution:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>College dorms full of stressed out students, particularly around exams</li>
        <li>Households of parents whose children have grown up and moved out</li>
        <li>Learning environments where access to interactions with exotic animals is difficult</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To envision how our solution might provide value in each of these contexts, we created video storyboards, and iterated upon them multiple times.</p>

      </div>

      <p><strong>Concept Implementation</strong></p>
      <p>Using our video storyboards as guidance, our team filmed our concept video and edited it with Adobe Premiere Pro. As for the logo and the overlaid interface, we experimented with a variety of iterations and received academic feedback before settling on our final designs.</p>
